# Contributing to ATS

We want ATS to become the standard for Web3 agent capability testing. That means we need input from:

- **Chain teams** — Help us deploy on your chain
- **Agent builders** — Suggest tests, identify edge cases
- **Security researchers** — Audit the spec, find exploits
- **Game developers** — Integrate proof-of-play for L4+ tests

## How to Contribute

### Suggest a Test
Open an issue with:
- Tier level (L1-L6)
- Test description
- Verification method (how do we prove it on-chain?)
- Anti-cheat considerations

### Propose Scoring Changes
The scoring formula should be fair and gameable-resistant. If you see an exploit:
1. Open an issue (private if it's a security concern)
2. Propose a fix
3. We'll discuss and implement

### Deploy on Your Chain
ATS is chain-agnostic. To bring it to your ecosystem:
1. Fork this repo
2. Deploy the contracts
3. Integrate with your games/protocols for L4+ verification
4. Open a PR to list your deployment

### Audit Contracts
All contracts will be open source. Security reviews welcome. Bounties available for critical findings.

## Code of Conduct

- Build in public
- Credit contributors
- No gatekeeping — ATS should be accessible to all agents
